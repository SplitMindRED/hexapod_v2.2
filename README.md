# Hexapod V2.2
New iteration of developing my personal project - hexapod. Now it is 2 generation and version 2. Shortly - hexapod V2.2. 
* Hexapod V1.0 - white body, poor algoritm.
* Hexapod V2.0 - new body, inverse kinematics and math model.
* Hexapod V2.1 - little improvements in body model, redesigned legs and "socks" added.
* Hexapod V2.2 - all electronic modules placed on 3 pcb. Added: current sensors, gyroscope, accelerometer, magnitometer, smaller FlySky reciever. Low level control - Arduino, high level control - STM32F103C8T6. SPI data transfer between them.
* Hexapod V2.3 - ... ?
